    How to write an effective About Us page (with 13 examples)
Learn best practices for creating an About Us page that tells your brand's story, connects with the audience, and builds trust.

An About Us page is an integral piece of content to have on your website.

Every single successful business has one, no matter their industry or what they sell.

After all, every brand has a story – and your About Us page helps you tell yours.

That’s important because, these days, story and connection matter more than ever to customers.

In a Demand Gen survey, 55% of B2B buyers said content that tells a strong, resonating story is what would make them most likely to talk to sales.

Because your About Us page is one of the first places customers will look to find out about your business and story, it’s a foundational page that deserves time and attention to get right.

Let’s talk about it, including how to write an About Us page.

What is an About Us page?
An About Us page isn’t just where you share the story of your brand. It’s also where you tell your customer what you do for them and how you work to meet their needs in that area.

It isn’t so much “Here’s what we’re about,” but more like “Here’s who we are, why we started, and what we can do for you.”

This page can go by many other names, by the way: 

“Our Mission”
“Our Story”
“About [brand name]” 
Or simply “About”
An About Us page can include a wide array of information, but the most common sections to include are:

Who you serve and what you do for them.
Your brand story/history, including how you got started.
Your mission and vision for the company.
Your brand values, what you believe in, and how you uphold those values in your day-to-day operations.
Mini bios of the people on your team.
An explanation of your process, how your services work, or how your products are made.
You can include all of these sections, some of them, or just one or two. 

It depends entirely on your business type, including your industry, what you sell, and how unique your products/services are. 

On top of that, take into account your brand voice as well as what your customers would be interested to know.

As you’ll soon see, some businesses devote one or two short paragraphs to their About page – and that’s it. Others tell a long story of how they were founded, and yet more have multiple pages within their About page wheelhouse. 

For example, if your brand is founded on strict environmental or ethical principles, you’ll probably spend more time explaining how you uphold those standards versus a brand that sells a simple, straightforward product.

How does an About Us page help your business and SEO?
We already mentioned that your About Us page is foundational to your website. That’s because customers expect it and look for it whenever they visit a new-to-them brand online.

People generally rank the About Us page as the second-most important element on your site (only contact information is rated higher in importance).

The About Us page as the second-most important website element.
For comparison, it rates higher than product images and videos, live chat, social media icons/links, and even a blog.

That’s reason enough to create a great About Us page. However, there are even more benefits to creating one that might not have crossed your mind.

Brand transparency
Transparency matters to customers. They want to know how you operate, what goes on behind the scenes, and that you’re true to your word. 

86% of U.S. consumers believe transparency in business matters now more than ever. To that end, your About Us page sets a standard for your transparency as a company overall.

Sharing values
Customers also want to know that the brands they support share their values. 

84% of consumers worldwide said they’re more likely to buy from a brand with values that match their own. Your About Us page is the perfect place to lay out those values and what you stand for.

Connecting with customers
Writing an About page also helps you connect with customers, often during one of their first interactions with your brand. 

Reading your story, mission, values, and purpose will help them relate to your company.

Boosting your website’s E-A-T
In terms of SEO, creating an About page isn’t necessarily about ranking the page in search. 

Instead, it adds a layer of expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T) to your site by explaining your background, your knowledge, and why you’re uniquely qualified to sell what you sell, offer the services you do, or discuss the topics you publish content about.
